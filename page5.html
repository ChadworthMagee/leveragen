    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Beige, Slate, Muted Teal) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard is chosen for its immediacy and ease of exploration. The structure is designed for a top-down analytical workflow: 1) High-level overview with key metrics and charts (KPIs, Stage Distribution, Geographic Spread). 2) Interactive exploration via filters and a searchable summary table. 3) Deep-dive into a specific company with a dynamic detail view that updates on selection. This non-linear, user-driven flow is more effective for due diligence than a static report, allowing users to compare companies and explore data based on their own criteria (e.g., "show me all Phase 1 companies in the UK"). -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Company counts, clinical stages, locations. -> Goal: Inform (Overview). -> Viz/Method: KPI cards and Donut/Bar charts (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Hover tooltips for details. -> Justification: Provides an immediate, quantitative snapshot of the landscape.
        - Report Info: Full company list. -> Goal: Organize/Compare. -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML Table. -> Interaction: Text search, dropdown filtering (by area, stage), and row selection. -> Justification: The core tool for user-driven exploration and comparison.
        - Report Info: Detailed company data (platform, funding, projection). -> Goal: Inform (Details). -> Viz/Method: Dynamic HTML content blocks. -> Interaction: Content updates on table row click. -> Justification: Presents comprehensive information for a selected company without navigating away, maintaining context.
        - All charts are rendered on Canvas via Chart.js, adhering to the no-SVG constraint. -->
